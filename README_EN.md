> Most enterprise macOS computers are managed via MDM, which prevents users from modifying screen lock settings. Additionally, many people now delegate tasks to LLM Agents and then... take a break. However, screen lock can cause AI agent tasks to fail, which is why this tool was developed.

> You can safely run it, and it will prevent the system from entering sleep mode through subtle (imperceptible) mouse movements.

## 📖 Use Cases

### Case 1: AI Agent Auto-Suspend
```
Problem: Enterprise policy auto-locks after 5 minutes, AI agent tasks fail due to screen lock network issues
Solution: Press ⌘ ⌃ S to enable anti-sleep, set longer interval (5-10 minutes)
```

### Case 2: Download/Processing Tasks ⏬
```
Problem: Long-running tasks but don't want screen always on
Solution: ⌘ ⌃ S + ⌘ ⌃ B (Low brightness mode saves power)
```

### Case 3: Remote Work 💻
```
Problem: Need to maintain connection but temporarily away
Solution: ⌘ ⌃ S to keep active, avoid disconnection
```

### Case 4: Video Playback 🎬
```
Problem: System auto-sleeps during video playback
Solution: Enable anti-sleep for uninterrupted viewing experience
```
